### Data Cleaning/Preparation
The dataset used for this project was assumed to be accurate, consistent, and reliable for analysis and reporting; therefore, data cleaning was not performed.
Basic SQL queries, aggregate functions, and join operations were used for data preparation.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
