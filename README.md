# MySQL Restaurant Order Analysis Project

### Project Overview
This guided data analysis project aims to provide insights into a restaurant to evaluate the performance of a new menu and understand customer preferences. This project utilized MySQL to perform data processing and data analysis. The primary goal was to analyze order data to identify the most and least popular menu items and types of cuisine.

### Data Source
Sales Data: The dataset used for this project can be found in the "data.zip" file, which was obtained from [here](https://mavenanalytics.io/data-playground?pageSize=10).

### Tools
* MySQL 

### Data Cleaning/Preparation
The dataset used for this project was assumed to be accurate, consistent, and reliable for analysis and reporting; therefore, data cleaning was not performed.
Basic SQL queries, aggregate functions, and join operations were used for data preparation.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
This project aimed to answer these key questions: 
1. What were the least and most ordered items? What categories were they in?
2. What were the top 5 orders that spent the most money?
3. View the details of the highest spending order. What insights can you gather?
4. View the details of the top 5 highest spend orders. What insights can you gather?

### Data Analysis
The menu featured 32 items, with Edamame at $5.00 being the least expensive and Shrimp Scampi at $19.95 being the most expensive. The menu was categorized as follows: 6 American, 8 Asian, 9 Mexican, and 9 Italian dishes. The average dish prices by category were $10.67 for American, $11.80 for Asian, $13.48 for Mexican, and $16.75 for Italian. Within the Italian category, which included 9 dishes, Spaghetti and Fettuccine Alfredo were the least expensive at $14.50, while Shrimp Scampi was the most expensive at $19.95.

Orders from January 1, 2023, to March 31, 2023, totaled 5,370, with 12,234 items ordered. The maximum number of items in a single order was 14, and only 20 orders contained more than 12 items.

### Results Findings
The analysis results are summarized as follows:
1. The least ordered item was chicken tacos, a Mexican cuisine, while the most ordered items were hamburgers, an American cuisine.
2. The top five orders with the highest spending were order numbers 440, 2075, 1957, 330, and 2675. The highest spending order, number 440, totaled $192.15.
3. The highest spending order predominantly purchased Italian cuisine, suggesting that Italian food is particularly popular among high-spending customers.
4. High-spending orders frequently include Italian cuisine, indicating that this category should be maintained on the menu due to its popularity and profitability.


### Recommendations
Based on the analysis, the following actions are recommended:
* Focus on popular items (hamburgers and Italian cuisine). Ensure quality and consider increasing prices.
* Reevaluate less popular items (chicken tacos). Consider removing it from the menu or changing the recipe.
* Promote high-spending categories with special deals or discounts.

### Limitations
The analysis is limited by the short time frame of the data, sample size, and data completeness.
